This setup is fundamental for maintaining high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability, which are essential for the system's overall reliability and performance.


#### Configuration and Features

The Eureka cluster consists of three instances, each configured to register with the others. This mutual registration forms a robust network of interdependent services. Key aspects of the setup include:

- **Service Discovery**:

  - Each Eureka server instance registers itself with the other instances, allowing microservices to query any of the Eureka servers to get the locations of other services.

- **High Availability**:

  - With three instances (`eurekaserver1`, `eurekaserver2`, and `eurekaserver3`), the cluster can tolerate the failure of one or even two instances without losing service discovery capabilities. This redundancy is critical for uninterrupted service availability.

- **Scalability**:

  - The cluster can efficiently handle an increasing number of microservices and instances. As the application scales, service discovery remains reliable and efficient.

- **Health Checks**:

  - Regular health checks are performed at 20-second intervals, with a 5-second timeout and up to 20 retries. These checks ensure that only healthy instances participate in service discovery. Instances that fail these checks are removed from the pool, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the system.

- **Self-Preservation Mode**:

  - Enabled by setting `EUREKA_SERVER_ENABLESELF_PRESERVATION` to "true", this mode prevents the eviction of instances from the registry if the number of renewals falls below a specified threshold. This threshold is set at 85% of the expected renewals, ensuring that transient network issues do not lead to unnecessary evictions and potential service disruptions.

- **Additional Settings**:

  - Other important settings include a renewal interval of 30 seconds, an eviction interval of 5 seconds, and a lease expiration duration of 90 seconds, all contributing to the robustness and responsiveness of the service discovery mechanism.

- **Client-Side Load Balancing**:

  - The current architecture employs client-side load balancing, where each microservice instance queries the Eureka server to discover other services and then selects an appropriate instance to communicate with.


#### Summary

The Eureka cluster is a vital component of the e-commerce microservice architecture, providing essential service discovery capabilities. The configuration with three interconnected instances ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. Regular health checks and self-preservation mode enhance the system's reliability by preventing unnecessary evictions during transient network issues. Client-side load balancing is employed due to the current single-instance setup per microservice, simplifying interactions and ensuring efficient communication. This robust setup supports the dynamic and scalable nature of the microservice architecture, significantly contributing to the overall stability and performance of the application.

# SAGA Pattern, Fallback, and WebSocket Notification

#### ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXccVLrWeM9IJ4zWUOwqtijxez8tsWxitm56sOKwQCQIjb2lCZRAdWmhSMMJO_LAUWaCuD5mWoyBANGcwqatzTSMMNjkLFIqxpwDBdyiCg71htC7M5UpleyjZ34efFpTGP2ZP8CGn1SsxU8qSBhy-a42Hpg?key=It25FaNN3Hk2ogZbUXQYcg)


#### Overview

The SAGA pattern is implemented to manage distributed transactions and ensure data consistency across microservices in the e-commerce architecture. It orchestrates a series of operations that can be rolled back in case of failures, maintaining the system's consistent state.


#### Workflow and Features

- **Order Creation**:

  - The system checks inventory availability when a user creates an order.

  - If sufficient inventory is available, items are reserved and the order status is set to âPENDING''.Â 

  - The order request is forwarded to the payment service via Kafka.

  - The reservation of items is managed to ensure that the inventory is not oversold.

- **Payment Processing**:

  - The payment service processes the payment and sends the result back through Kafka.

  - If the message fails to be sent from the order service or the payment fails, the system reverts the item quantity back to its original state.

  - The order service consumes the payment result, updates the order status, and notifies the frontend using WebSocket.

  - Payment processing includes retries with exponential backoff, starting from 1 second up to a maximum of 32 seconds, to handle transient failures.

- **Error Handling**:

  - If message sending fails or the payment is unsuccessful, the order status is set to "FAILED".Â 

  - If the payment is successful, the order status is set to âCOMPLETEDâ.

  - The order service manages failed messages by retrying up to five times or categorizing them for manual inspection if retries exceed the limit.

  - Failed payment requests and messages are logged and stored in a MySQL database for further analysis and resolution.

- **WebSocket Notifications**:

  - The order service uses WebSocket to notify the frontend of order status changes in real-time, ensuring a seamless user experience.

  - This ensures that users are promptly informed of their order status, whether it is completed or failed.


#### Summary

The SAGA pattern ensures data consistency and reliable transaction management across distributed microservices. By orchestrating operations and providing mechanisms for rollback in case of failures, it maintains the system's integrity. The combination of order creation, payment processing, and robust error handling within the SAGA framework significantly enhances the reliability and consistency of the e-commerce application, ensuring a seamless and trustworthy user experience. This approach enables the system to handle complex transactions while maintaining data integrity and providing a responsive user interface.


# MySQL Master-Slave Setup and Optimistic Locking

#### ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeNDO-H90xqvvqfqmmbunN9ZCbGLvz65A0dhv6-H3WwO5wky_tomy_8wHkT2X5LNdDE5ttJOOCNrsHVQh8gOHDZ0ExDV3U2YMY67Ge8IMjdQQfIo1CBaS6V9dd7dKh0WPJbJc6ilA5h4P1K4_JF_vLwoGs2?key=It25FaNN3Hk2ogZbUXQYcg)

#### Overview

The e-commerce microservice architecture employs a MySQL master-slave setup for the item, user, and order microservices. This setup is designed to enhance data reliability, availability, and read performance. Additionally, optimistic locking is utilized in the user profile update function to ensure data integrity during concurrent updates.


#### Master-Slave Setup

- **Concept**:

  - The master-slave setup involves one master database handling write operations and one or more slave databases handling read operations. This setup improves performance by offloading read operations to the slave, reducing the load on the master database.

- **Implementation**:

  - **User Service**:

    1. The user service utilizes a master database (`userservice-master`) and a slave database (`userservice-slave`).

    2. The master database manages all write operations, such as creating, updating, and deleting user records.

    3. The slave database is read-only and is used for read operations, such as fetching user details.

  - **Order Service**:

    1. The order service employs a similar setup with `orderservice-master` as the master database and a corresponding slave for read operations.

  - **Item Service**:

    1. The item service also follows this configuration, ensuring efficient management of inventory data.

- **Replication**:

  - Replication between the master and slave databases is asynchronous. The master database logs all changes in the binary log (`log_bin`), which the slave database then reads and applies to itself.

  - **Binlog Format**:

    1. The Binlog format can be set to `STATEMENT`, `ROW`, or `MIXED`.

       - **Statement-based Logging** records the SQL statements executed.

       - **Row-based Logging** records the actual changes made to individual rows.

       - **Mixed Logging** uses a combination of both, depending on the type of SQL statement executed.

    2. For this setup, **row-based logging** (`ROW`) is chosen to ensure a more accurate and detailed replication, especially useful for complex transactions.

  - **Data Replication Procedure**:

    1. The slave server executes `START SLAVE` to enable replication. The slave server's I/O thread requests to read the Binlog from the master server. If the I/O thread catches up with the master, it enters a sleep state.

    2. The master server writes update SQL operations (such as `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`) to the Binlog. The master server's Binlog dump thread sends the Binlog contents to the slave server.

    3. After starting, the slave server creates an I/O thread to read the Binlog content sent by the master and writes it to the relay log, recording the position to continue reading next time.

    4. The slave server's SQL thread continuously checks the relay log for new log entries, converts them into SQL statements, and executes them.

  - This asynchronous replication ensures that read operations on the slave database do not impact the performance of write operations on the master database.

- **Health Checks**:

  - Health checks are configured to ensure the databases are running correctly. These checks run every 10 seconds with a timeout of 30 seconds, allowing up to 10 retries.


#### Service Layer Database Selection

- **Dynamic Data Source Routing**:

  - The service layer uses a dynamic data source routing mechanism to select the appropriate database (master or slave) for each operation.

  - A `ReplicationRoutingDataSource` class is implemented to determine the current lookup key based on the context. It uses a thread-local variable to store and retrieve the data source type (`MASTER` or `SLAVE`).

  - When performing write operations, the context is set to use the master database. For read operations, the context is set to use the slave database.

  - This routing ensures that read-heavy operations do not interfere with write operations, optimizing the overall database performance.


#### Optimistic Locking in User Profile Updating

- **Concept**:

  - Optimistic locking is a concurrency control mechanism used to prevent data inconsistencies during concurrent updates. It uses a version field to track changes to an entity.

- **Implementation**:

  - The `User` and `Address` entities are annotated with `@Version`, which adds a version field that is automatically incremented with each update.

  - During the update process, the version field is checked. If the version in the database does not match the version in the update request, an `OptimisticLockException` is thrown, indicating a concurrent modification.

  - This mechanism ensures that only one update can succeed at a time, preventing overwriting changes made by other transactions.

- **Reason for Selecting Optimistic Locking**:

  - Optimistic locking is selected over pessimistic locking to reduce the potential for database contention and deadlocks.

  - Pessimistic locking involves locking the record for the entire duration of the transaction, which can lead to significant performance bottlenecks and scalability issues in high-concurrency environments.

  - Optimistic locking allows multiple transactions to proceed without locking the records, only checking for conflicts at the time of the update. This approach is more efficient and scalable, especially for web applications with a high number of concurrent users.


#### Summary

The MySQL master-slave setup and optimistic locking mechanism are crucial components of the e-commerce microservice architecture, providing enhanced reliability, availability, and data integrity.

- **Master-Slave Setup**:

  - Improves read performance by offloading read operations to the slave databases.

  - Ensures high availability and reliability by providing redundancy and load balancing.

  - Utilizes asynchronous replication to maintain data consistency between master and slave databases.

  - Implements row-based binary logging for accurate and detailed replication.

  - Configured with health checks and proper logging to maintain system integrity.

- **Optimistic Locking**:

  - Ensures data integrity during concurrent updates by preventing overwriting of data.

  - Uses a version control mechanism on entities to manage concurrency.

  - Selected over pessimistic locking to reduce potential database contention and deadlocks, improving performance and scalability.

These strategies collectively enhance the stability, performance, and reliability of the e-commerce application, ensuring a smooth and trustworthy user experience.

#### Overview

Keycloak is used as the OAuth2 server in the e-commerce microservice architecture to handle authentication and authorization. Integrating Keycloak with Spring Security provides a robust security framework that ensures secure access to various services and APIs based on user roles and permissions.


#### Configuration and Features

- **Keycloak Setup**:

  - **Container Configuration**:

    - Keycloak runs in a Docker container, configured with an admin user and password.

    - The realm configuration `XianweiECommerce` is imported during startup to define security policies and user roles, restoring the realm and client settings.

  - **Health Check**:

    - A health check is configured to ensure Keycloak is ready to accept requests, running every 20 seconds with a timeout of 5 seconds, allowing up to 20 retries.

- **Spring Security Integration**:

  - **Security Configurations**:

    - Spring Security is configured to work with Keycloak, enabling OAuth2 resource server capabilities.

    - The configuration uses `SecurityWebFilterChain` to define security rules for public and authenticated endpoints.

    - Public endpoints are accessible without authentication, while other endpoints require specific roles or authentication.

  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:

    - A custom role converter (`KeycloakRoleConverter`) is used to map Keycloak roles to Spring Security `GrantedAuthority` objects.

    - This converter extracts roles from the JWT token provided by Keycloak and assigns them to the authenticated user.


#### Implementation Details

- **Authentication and Authorization**:

  - **JWT Authentication**:

    - The application uses JWT tokens issued by Keycloak for authentication. The tokens include user roles and permissions, which are used to enforce access control.

    - The `JwtAuthenticationConverter` is configured to use the custom role converter, ensuring that roles from the token are correctly interpreted by Spring Security.

  - **Security Filters**:

    - Two security filter chains are defined:

      - **Public Endpoints**: Accessible without authentication (e.g., public user profiles, feedback).

      - **Authenticated Endpoints**: Require authentication and specific roles (e.g., admin-specific APIs, user profile updates).

- **Role Management**:

  - **Admin Role**:

    - Specific endpoints (e.g., CRUD operations on categories) are restricted to users with the "ADMIN" role.

    - The `AdminController` and associated services enforce these restrictions, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

  - **User Role**:

    - Other endpoints require the user to be authenticated but do not necessarily require admin privileges (e.g., updating user profiles, managing carts).


#### Authentication Procedure

1. **Token Retrieval**:

   - The frontend application sends user credentials (username and password) to Keycloak.

   - Keycloak validates the credentials and, upon successful authentication, issues a JWT token to the frontend.

2. **Sending Requests with Token**:

   - The frontend includes the JWT token in the Authorization header of requests to the resource server, which in this case is the Spring Cloud Gateway.

3. **Token Validation and Access Grant**:

   - The Spring Cloud Gateway is registered with Keycloak and has access to Keycloak's public key.

   - The gateway validates the JWT token using this public key. If the token is valid, the gateway grants access to the requested resource by forwarding the request to the appropriate microservice.


#### Security and Reliability

- **Security**:

  - **OAuth2 and JWT**:

    - Using OAuth2 and JWT ensures secure and stateless authentication, with tokens containing all necessary user information and permissions.

    - Tokens are validated by Spring Security before granting access to protected resources.

  - **Role-Based Access Control**:

    - RBAC ensures that only users with the appropriate roles can access certain endpoints, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized access.

- **Reliability**:

  - **Health Checks**:

    - Regular health checks on the Keycloak container ensure it is always ready to handle authentication requests, improving reliability.

  - **Scalability**:

    - The architecture can scale horizontally by adding more instances of Keycloak and configuring them in a high-availability setup.

  - **Token Management**:

    - JWT tokens reduce the need for constant communication with the authentication server, improving performance and reliability.


#### Summary
